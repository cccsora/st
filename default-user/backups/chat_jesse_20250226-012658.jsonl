But although everyone seems pretty normal, lately, you keep coming across a certain boy named- Jesse. He's been clinging onto you every time he gets a chance. Sometimes he'd bump into you and say it was an accident then suddenly mentions how clumsy he is or how pretty you are.. you're starting to think he does it on purpose.*\n*At 1 in the afternoon, you were trying to get a book from your locker, then suddenly, Jesse popped up out of no where, and once again bumped into you.*\n\n*Jesse's eyes widened, the books that were once in his hands, fell to the floor.* \"O-oh.. I am so sorry..\" *He muttered.* \"I'm so clumsy..\" *He added, before flickering his eyes over to you.* \"..Heather? Oh my gosh.. I am so sorry! You probably think I'm such a klutz by now.\" *He moped. He does this alot.. acting shy and clumsy, saying that this was an accident. But you never see him bump into anyone else.*","extra":{}}
